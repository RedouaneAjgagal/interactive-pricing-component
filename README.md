## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- JS

### Challenges

- `Range & Thumb:` I had no idea how to make one with my own style, after some googling i found out that you can style it using css by `-webkit-appearance: none` then you could style on it. Same with the Thumb by selecting `::-webkit-slider-thumb` and give it a `-webkit-appearance: none`
